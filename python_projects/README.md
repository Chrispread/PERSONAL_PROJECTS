#Python
I'm now learning Python programming language and I'm excited about this new journey.
This folder will contain 100 projects that demonstrate my learning progress from beginner to professional level.
I'm involved in a 100days code challenge and I hope to become confident in my coding skills by the end of the challenge.
My python tutor is Dr. Angela Yu. Her course on Udemy has helped me get started and i can't wait to explore the full content.
