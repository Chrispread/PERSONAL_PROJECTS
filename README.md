# PERSONAL_PROJECTS
This repository is the collection of my personal projects. I have decided to strengthen my coding skills by constantly working on projects. 
I keep learning new things daily and this repo is an archive of my coding journey, from little baby steps to advanced programming.
I will update it frequently as my skills advance.
